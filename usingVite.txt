To use Vite, navigate to the folder you want to create the new project in.
Go to the terminal (or integrated terminal in VS code), and type in npm init vite. 
Then fill out the project name, package name, and select the type of package you would like to use.
Then type cd projectNameYouJustCreated. This will take you to the directory of the project you created.
(This new project will more than likely be in the HOME folder of your mac. You can move it to any new folder with no problem.)
Then, and npm install three.
Finally type npm run dev.
Any time you want to start a server, you have to type npm run dev. Then cmd click the link to open it in a web browser.

When you use Vite, you can use "import * as THREE from 'three';"
To do this, you will have to make the script that reads your main.js into a type="module";

If you do not use Vite, you can simply add the three.js file (not the large folder) as a script into your index.html file
before the main.js file.
Then you do not have to use "import * as THREE from 'three';"
